# Console Car Game (C++)

## Project Overview
This project is a console-based car racing game developed in C++ using ASCII graphics.  
The player controls a car positioned at the bottom of the screen and must avoid enemy cars coming from the top.  
The objective is to survive as long as possible while increasing the score each time an enemy car is successfully passed.

## Gameplay Description
The game starts with a simple menu that allows the player to begin or exit.  During gameplay, the car is controlled using keyboard inputs.  
Enemy cars appear at random positions within the road boundaries.  Collision detection determines game over conditions.  
After a collision, the player can choose to replay or quit.  Smooth movement is achieved using timed delays.

## Technologies Used
The project is written in C++.  It uses Windows-specific libraries such as <conio.h> and <windows.h> for keyboard input handling and console manipulation.  
This makes the game compatible only with Windows systems.

## Purpose of the Project
This project was developed as a team-based academic assignment to strengthen understanding of C++ fundamentals, including functions, arrays, game loops, and basic game logic.  
It also serves as a foundation for learning collaborative development practices.  
The project can be extended with additional features such as increased difficulty, more enemies, or enhanced visuals.
